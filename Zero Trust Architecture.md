# **Zero Trust Architecture on GCP**

Zero Trust is a security model that assumes no user or system is trusted by default, even if they're inside the network. It requires strict identity verification and continuous monitoring.


### **1. Identity and Access Management (IAM)**  
Use **IAM** policies to ensure that users and services only have access to the resources they need.  
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Limit permissions to the bare minimum necessary.
- **IAM Roles and Policies**:  
```hcl
resource "google_project_iam_member" "example" {
  project = "my-project"
  role    = "roles/viewer"
  member  = "user:john.doe@example.com"
}
```

- **Cloud Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP)**: Protect apps and services by requiring authentication and authorization through Google Identity.  
```hcl
resource "google_iap_web_backend_service" "iap_service" {
  name       = "iap-backend"
  backend_service = google_compute_backend_service.hybrid_backend.id
}
```

---

### **2. Network Security**  
**VPC Service Controls** help create security perimeters to protect GCP resources, reducing the risk of data exfiltration.  
- **Private Google Access**: Prevents GCP services from accessing the internet.
- **VPC Peering/Interconnect**: Allows for secure, private communication between services and regions.

Example of setting up a VPC with private services:  
```hcl
resource "google_compute_network" "vpc_network" {
  name                    = "my-vpc"
  auto_create_subnetworks = false
}

resource "google_compute_subnetwork" "subnet" {
  name          = "my-subnet"
  region        = "us-central1"
  network       = google_compute_network.vpc_network.id
  private_ip_google_access = true
}
```

---

### **3. Device & Endpoint Security**  
Ensure that only trusted devices and endpoints are allowed to access resources:  
- **Google Endpoint Verification**: Enforce compliance by verifying that devices meet your security standards.
- **Cloud Armor**: Use for **DDoS protection**, **WAF** for layer 7 filtering, and **Rate-based** rules to detect and mitigate attacks.

---

### **4. Continuous Monitoring & Threat Detection**  
**Cloud Security Command Center (SCC)** and **Cloud Audit Logs** provide insights into security activities.  
- **Security Health Analytics**: Alerts for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.
- **Event Threat Detection**: Detects anomalous events based on machine learning.

Example of using SCC to monitor resources:
```hcl
resource "google_securitycenter_notification_config" "example" {
  notification_channel = "projects/my-project/notificationChannels/your-channel-id"
  event_config {
    event_type = "UNAUTHORIZED_ACCESS"
    notification_config = {
      notification_type = "ALL"
    }
  }
}
```

---

### **5. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) & Single Sign-On (SSO)**  
Enforce **MFA** for all user accounts and integrate with **SSO** to centralize authentication.  
- **Google Identity Platform** supports both.
- Use **OAuth 2.0** and **OpenID Connect** for app access.  

---

### **6. Service Mesh (Istio)**  
Deploy **Istio** as a service mesh to ensure secure communication between microservices using mTLS. This provides mutual authentication and authorization for services, enhancing security.  
- **Zero Trust Communication**: Each service is authenticated and authorized to communicate.

---

### **7. Data Encryption and Protection**  
- **Encryption at Rest**: Ensure that all data is encrypted by default in Cloud Storage, BigQuery, and other GCP services.
- **Cloud KMS**: Use **Cloud Key Management Service** to manage encryption keys.

Example of KMS setup:  
```hcl
resource "google_kms_key_ring" "key_ring" {
  name     = "my-key-ring"
  location = "global"
}

resource "google_kms_crypto_key" "crypto_key" {
  name     = "my-crypto-key"
  key_ring = google_kms_key_ring.key_ring.id
  purpose  = "ENCRYPT_DECRYPT"
}
```

  Chronicle integrates natively with Google Cloud services, including VPC Flow Logs, IAM Logs, Cloud Logging, Cloud Security Command Center, and more.
  
- **Step 2: Enable Chronicle’s Machine Learning Detection Models**:  
  Chronicle leverages machine learning to detect anomalous activity. Enable predefined detection rules that match the described scenarios or create custom detection rules.

- **Step 3: Define Response Actions**:  
  Chronicle allows you to set up automated responses via integrations with Cloud Functions, Cloud Pub/Sub, or external security tools.

- **Step 4: Create Alerting Policies**:  
  Use Chronicle’s alerting mechanisms to notify your team about any identified security threats. Alerts can be sent to various communication channels (e.g., Slack, email, or SIEM systems).

To automate the **Zero Trust Architecture** and **Google Chronicle Security Monitoring** setup using **Terraform Cloud**, we need to implement Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) for:  

1. **Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) on GCP**
   - Implement IAM best practices
   - Set up VPC Service Controls
   - Configure Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP)
   - Enforce organization-wide security policies

2. **Google Chronicle Security Monitoring**
   - Configure log sinks for security logs
   - Set up Chronicle ingestion pipelines
   - Deploy security detection rules for advanced threat scenarios
   - Automate response mechanisms via Cloud Functions

---

### **Step 1: Terraform Cloud Setup**
1. **Create a Terraform Cloud workspace**  
   - Set up a Terraform Cloud account  
   - Create a new **workspace** in Terraform Cloud for the **ZTA + Chronicle** deployment  
   - Configure Terraform Cloud to store the state remotely  

2. **Store GCP credentials securely**  
   - Add GCP service account keys as environment variables in Terraform Cloud  
   - Ensure proper IAM permissions for Terraform execution  

---

### **Step 2: Terraform Code Structure**
We will create the following Terraform modules:

1. **`zero-trust/`**
   - Implements VPC Service Controls, IAM policies, Cloud Armor, Identity-Aware Proxy, etc.

2. **`chronicle/`**
   - Deploys Google Chronicle integrations, log sinks, and detection rules.

3. **`security-automation/`**
   - Configures security automation via Cloud Functions, Pub/Sub, and alerts.

---

### **Step 3: Zero Trust Architecture Setup**
#### **1. IAM Best Practices in Terraform**
```hcl
resource "google_organization_iam_binding" "no_external_users" {
  org_id = "YOUR_ORG_ID"
  role   = "roles/iam.securityAdmin"

  members = [
    "user:admin@yourdomain.com",
    "serviceAccount:terraform@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
  ]
}
```
- Restricts IAM access to trusted accounts only  
- Can be extended with custom constraints  

#### **2. VPC Service Controls**
```hcl
resource "google_access_context_manager_service_perimeter" "secure_perimeter" {
  name        = "secure-perimeter"
  title       = "Secure Perimeter"
  description = "Restrict data movement"
  parent      = "accessPolicies/YOUR_ACCESS_POLICY_ID"

  status {
    resources = ["projects/YOUR_PROJECT_ID"]
    restricted_services = [
      "bigquery.googleapis.com",
      "storage.googleapis.com"
    ]
  }
}
```
- Prevents data exfiltration by restricting service communication  

#### **3. Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP)**
```hcl
resource "google_iap_web_backend_service_iam_binding" "iap_bind" {
  project = "YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
  role    = "roles/iap.httpsResourceAccessor"

  members = [
    "user:admin@yourdomain.com"
  ]
}
```
- Ensures only authenticated users can access protected services  

#### **4. Cloud Armor WAF & DDoS Protection**
```hcl
resource "google_compute_security_policy" "default" {
  name   = "secure-waf-policy"
  action = "deny-403"

  rule {
    action   = "allow"
    priority = 1000
    match {
      expr {
        expression = "request.headers['X-User'] == 'trusted-user'"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
- Implements a Web Application Firewall (WAF)  
- Restricts access based on user identity  

---

### **Step 4: Google Chronicle Setup**
#### **1. Enable Chronicle API**
```hcl
resource "google_project_service" "chronicle" {
  project = "YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
  service = "chronicle.googleapis.com"
}
```
- Ensures Chronicle is activated in your GCP project  

#### **2. Log Sink to Chronicle**
```hcl
resource "google_logging_project_sink" "chronicle_sink" {
  name        = "chronicle-logs"
  destination = "pubsub.googleapis.com/projects/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/topics/chronicle-ingestion"

  filter = "severity>=ERROR"
}
```
- Sends security logs from GCP to Chronicle  

#### **3. Chronicle Threat Detection Rules**
```hcl
resource "google_chronicle_detection_rule" "ransomware_detection" {
  rule_id   = "ransomware-detection"
  rule_yaml = <<EOT
rule "Ransomware Activity" {
  source = event
  condition = event.metadata.severity == "HIGH" &&
              event.type == "file_modification" &&
              event.file_extension in ["encrypted", "lock"]
}
EOT
}
```
- Detects ransomware file encryption patterns  

---

### **Step 5: Security Automation**
#### **1. Pub/Sub + Cloud Functions for Auto-Response**
```hcl
resource "google_pubsub_topic" "security_alerts" {
  name = "security-alerts"
}

resource "google_cloudfunctions_function" "auto_response" {
  name        = "auto-response"
  runtime     = "python39"
  entry_point = "respond_to_threat"

  event_trigger {
    event_type = "google.pubsub.topic.publish"
    resource   = google_pubsub_topic.security_alerts.id
  }
}
```
- Triggers automatic security responses  

#### **2. Cloud Monitoring Alerts**
```hcl
resource "google_monitoring_alert_policy" "unauthorized_access" {
  display_name = "Unauthorized Access Alert"
  combiner     = "OR"

  conditions {
    display_name = "Multiple Failed Logins"
    condition_threshold {
      filter          = "metric.type=\"logging.googleapis.com/user/logins_failed_count\" AND severity>=ERROR"
      threshold_value = 5
    }
  }

  notification_channels = [google_monitoring_notification_channel.email_alert.id]
}
```
- Alerts on multiple failed logins  

---

### **Step 6: Deploy to Terraform Cloud**
#### **1. Connect Terraform Cloud to GitHub**
- Push your Terraform code to a GitHub repository  
- Connect Terraform Cloud to your GitHub repo  

#### **2. Apply Changes via Terraform Cloud**
```sh
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply -auto-approve
```
- Deploys Zero Trust and Chronicle setup automatically  

---

### **Next Steps**
1. **Extend Chronicle detection rules** for other advanced security threats.  
2. **Set up a Terraform Cloud run schedule** to continuously enforce security policies.  
3. **Integrate with external SIEM tools** (e.g., Splunk, Elastic Security).
